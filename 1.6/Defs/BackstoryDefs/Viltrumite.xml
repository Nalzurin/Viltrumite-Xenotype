    <description>Born into the militaristic and expansionist Viltrum Empire, [PAWN_nameDef] was trained from an early age to subdue and conquer worlds. As a child, [PAWN_pronoun] was taught the art of warfare, strategic dominance, and the importance of Viltrumite superiority. Sparring matches were brutal, and weakness was never tolerated.\n By the age of ten, [PAWN_pronoun] had already seen more combat than most humans experience in a lifetime.</description>
